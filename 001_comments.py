# All comments in python begin with a '#' also commonly known as a hash-mark,
# pound sign, and an octothorpe

# Comments are lines in a file that are not executed as instructions by the
# interpreter. You can write normal language in comments.

# Comments are very important in all kinds of code. They help other
# programmers and even the person writing the code to understand what they're
# reading at a later time.

# Not every line of code needs a comment.

# Throughout the rest of the files in this introduction, we, the authors, have
# left copious amounts of comments so you can refer back to these files as you
# continue journey into the wonderful world of programming.
