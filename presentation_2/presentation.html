# Errors and Exceptions

Human-written code always yields errors, so we need to handle them. In Python we
use Exceptions.

---

# An Error

 I mentioned earlier that if you have a dictionary and try to retrieve a
 value from a key that doesn't exist, you'll see an error. You can look
 at this error by uncommenting the next line:
 {}['a key not in the dictionary']
 You should see something like:

```python
 Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
 KeyError: 'a key not in the dictionary'

```

---

# How do we prevent errors? Or handle them?

 The last line contains the name of the error "KeyError". We can catch that
 error to prevent it from stopping the program. For example,

```python
  try:
      {}['a key not in the dictionary']
  except KeyError:
      print('Caught a KeyError')
```

---

# More errors
 There are similar errors when working with lists and tuples. If you try to
 get an element from an empty list or tuple, you'll get an IndexError

```python
try:
    [][0]
except IndexError:
    print('Caught an IndexError')
```

 The same can happen if the index you're trying to access an index that's too
 large.

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
try:
    my_tuple[20]
except IndexError as error:
    print(error)
```

 We can bind the actual error to a name, like "error" as we did above and
 just print that!

---

#Exceptions: Concluded
 This concludes the section on exceptions. The important take away is that
 you get to define what happens when an exception is raised. Above we're only
 printing information about the exception but you can do anything inside an
 except block.
