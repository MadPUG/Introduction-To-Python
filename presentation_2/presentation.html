# Errors and Exceptions

Human-written code always yields errors, so we need to handle them. In Python we
use Exceptions.

---

# An Error

 I mentioned earlier that if you have a dictionary and try to retrieve a
 value from a key that doesn't exist, you'll see an error. You can look
 at this error by uncommenting the next line:
 {}['a key not in the dictionary']
 You should see something like:

```python
 Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
 KeyError: 'a key not in the dictionary'

```

---

# How do we prevent errors? Or handle them?

 The last line contains the name of the error "KeyError". We can catch that
 error to prevent it from stopping the program. For example,

```python
  try:
      {}['a key not in the dictionary']
  except KeyError:
      print('Caught a KeyError')
```

---

# More errors
 There are similar errors when working with lists and tuples. If you try to
 get an element from an empty list or tuple, you'll get an IndexError

```python
try:
    [][0]
except IndexError:
    print('Caught an IndexError')
```

 The same can happen if the index you're trying to access an index that's too
 large.

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
try:
    my_tuple[20]
except IndexError as error:
    print(error)
```

 We can bind the actual error to a name, like "error" as we did above and
 just print that!

---

#Exceptions: Concluded
 This concludes the section on exceptions. The important take away is that
 you get to define what happens when an exception is raised. Above we're only
 printing information about the exception but you can do anything inside an
 except block.

---

# Functions

Conjunction function...? no. no...

---

 We've already used functions in every part of the presentation thus far.
 Each time we do print(...) we're using a function, but we haven't created
 our own functions.

---

 First let's talk about why functions are useful. Any time you're repeating
 some block of code you're immediately writing way too much code. Remember in
 our dictionaries lesson where we were doing
 print(alpha_ordering.get('z', 'There is no letter that'),
       "comes after 'z' in the alphabet")
 And we had to copy and paste that for any other letter we wanted to give the
 same treatement to? That would be the perfect candidate for a function.

---
 Let's make this our first function. Bring in this dictionary:
```python
alpha_ordering = {
    'a': 'b',
    'b': 'c',
    'c': 'd',
    'd': 'e',
    'e': 'f',
    'f': 'g',
    'g': 'h',
    'h': 'i',
    'i': 'j',
    'j': 'k',
    'k': 'l',
    'l': 'm',
    'm': 'n',
    'n': 'o',
    'o': 'p',
    'p': 'q',
    'q': 'r',
    'r': 's',
    's': 't',
    't': 'u',
    'u': 'v',
    'v': 'w',
    'w': 'x',
    'x': 'y',
    'y': 'z',
}
```

---

 Now let's start writing our function. Functions are *def*ined and given
 names. To create a function you start with "def" followed by the function
 name. We'll call our function "print_next_letter". Function names have to
 start with a letter (upper- or lower-case) or underscore ("_") and then can
 be followed by a letter, number, or underscore. After the function we use
 parentheses to start the list of arguments a function requires.

```python
def print_next_letter(alphabet_dictionary, previous_letter):
    # Then we put the actual instructions for the function inside, indented
    # once.
    default = 'There is no letter that'
    # We can use a variable to store the default return value here.
    print(alphabet_dictionary.get(previous_letter, default),
          "comes after '{0}' in the alphabet.".format(previous_letter))
```

---

 When defining our function we chose to require that the alphabet_dictionary
 be provided as the first argument, and which letter we want to find the next
 value for. Let's use it!

```python
print_next_letter(alpha_ordering, 'a')
print_next_letter(alpha_ordering, 'z')
```

 It works!
 But there's something that's bothering me here. The output looks like:
 "b comes after 'a' in the alphabet."
 and I would much rather it look like:
 "'b' comes after 'a' in the alphabet."
 Let's make a new function that does this!

---

We'll call this one print_next_letter2
```python
def print_next_letter2(alphabet_dictionary, previous_letter):
    default = 'There is no letter that'
    try:
        first_part = "'{0}'".format(alphabet_dictionary[previous_letter])
    except KeyError:
        first_part = default
    print(first_part,
          "comes after '{0}' in the alphabet.".format(previous_letter))
```

Let's see how that looks:

```python
print_next_letter2(alpha_ordering, 'd')
print_next_letter2(alpha_ordering, 'z')
```
 MUCH BETTER!

---

 Function paramters (or arguments) can have default values. For example,
 we don't really need to pass alpha_ordering in every time we want to print
 the next letter in the alphabet. That would be really tedious after a while.
 Let's make a new function.

```python
def print_next_letter3(previous_letter, alphabet_dictionary=alpha_ordering):
```
     So we don't end up copying and pasting code, let's reuse:

```python
     print_next_letter2
    print_next_letter2(alpha_ordering, previous_letter)
```


 Now let's use it
```python
print_next_letter3('g')
print_next_letter3('z')
```

It works! Notice, though, that we had to change the ordering of the
arguments for this new function. Arguments with default values have to come
after arguments without default values. We can also create a new dictionary
for uppercase letters and still use print_next_letter3.

---

```python
upper_alpha_ordering = {}
for (key, value) in alpha_ordering.items():
    upper_alpha_ordering[key.upper()] = value.upper()

# Now we can do any of the following:
print_next_letter3('I', alphabet_dictionary=upper_alpha_ordering)
print_next_letter3('M', upper_alpha_ordering)
# Or
print_next_letter2(upper_alpha_ordering, 'Y')
# Both are equivalent and both are correct.
```

I personally prefer either the first or the last to the second option. When
passing a value to an argument with a default value it is nice to name it
for your future self and for others.
---

 In fact as long as you know the names of parameters, you can name each
 parameter you pass. For example, we could write
 print_next_letter2(upper_alpha_ordering, 'Y')
 as
```python
print_next_letter2(alphabet_dictionary=upper_alpha_ordering,
                  previous_letter='Y')
```
 In fact, if we're passing the values by name explicitly, we can even reorder
 them!
```python
print_next_letter2(previous_letter='Y',
                   alphabet_dictionary=upper_alpha_ordering)
```
 This does not mean we can do
 print_next_letter2('Y', alphabet_dictionary=upper_alpha_ordering)
 Or
 print_next_letter2('Y', upper_alpha_ordering)

#Modules

 Up until now, everything we've seen in python just exists. You also may have
 come to this presentation having heard that Python comes with "batteries
 included". When people say that Python has "batteries included" they mean
 that Python comes with a standard set of well-built modules of code for you.
 This set is often called the standard library (or stdlib). The contents of
 these modules are not automatically available to you whenever you need them
 though. To use a library (or module) you have to "import" it. You can also
 import specific things from a library or module.

---

 Let's look at some cool standard libraries.

 The first one we'll look at allows you to open URLs in the operating
 system's default web browser
```python
import webbrowser
```
 Once we've importanted, we use a '.' to access functions and other things
 contained in the module. In this case the module offers us an 'open'
 function. We can use this function much like a method on a list or
 dictionary.
```python
webbrowser.open('https://docs.python.org/library/webbrowser')
```
 That should have opened up the online documentation for the webbrowser
 module. It should show you other functions inside the module that you
 can use to experiment with.

---
 Next we'll look at a module that does pretty printing for you. We really
 only want one function from this library though: the 'pprint' function.
 Let's only import that from the module like so:
```python
from pprint import pprint
```
---
 We can now pass in a large dictionary to pretty print... like:
```python
pprint({
    'a': 'b',
    'b': 'c',
    'c': 'd',
    'd': 'e',
    'e': 'f',
    'f': 'g',
    'g': 'h',
    'h': 'i',
    'i': 'j',
    'j': 'k',
    'k': 'l',
    'l': 'm',
    'm': 'n',
    'n': 'o',
    'o': 'p',
    'p': 'q',
    'q': 'r',
    'r': 's',
    's': 't',
    't': 'u',
    'u': 'v',
    'v': 'w',
    'w': 'x',
    'x': 'y',
    'y': 'z',
})
```
---
 If we were to print our trusty alphabetic dictionary otherwise, it would
 probably look kind of terrible.

 There are a lot more cool and useful modules in the standard library but I
 really wanted to show you all ones that would be relevant to your interests.
 I can't think of any other very generic ones so feel free to use the rest of
 tonight to ask me about anything we've done thus far and for recommendations
 about modules.

---
# Extra credit

 You also have a lot of modules that exist but which do not come with Python
 by default. The most common place to find these modules is at
 https://pypi.python.org/
 To install modules from there, you should save the file found at
 https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
 And then run it like so:
 python get-pip.py
 python.exe get-pip.py
 Then you can install a package from PyPI (The Python Package Index) and use
 it as if it were part of Python (like we were using modules above). We will
 talk about this more next month.
 There is even more to learn about functions but we'll save that for another
 time.
